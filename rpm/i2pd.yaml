    %{summary}.

    I2P (Invisible Internet Protocol) is a universal anonymous network layer.
    All communications over I2P are anonymous and end-to-end encrypted,
    participants don't reveal their real IP addresses.

    I2P client is a software used for building and using anonymous I2P
    networks. Such networks are commonly used for anonymous peer-to-peer
    applications (filesharing, cryptocurrencies) and anonymous client-server
    applications (websites, instant messengers, chat-servers).

    I2P allows people from all around the world to communicate and share
    information without restrictions.

    Notices for SailfishOS:  
      the config lives in `/home/.system/var/lib/i2pd`, not `/etc`  
      the web console is reachable at http://127.0.0.1:7070
